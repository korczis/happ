# Happ

## About

Application for learning, practicing and improving programming skills. 
This application begun as toy project during my hospitalization.
There is no specific plan, goal neither roadmap.
It is just for joy of learning and to have some fun.

## Motivation

### Primary

- Implement "Hello World" program in various programming languages
- Implement FFI - Foreign Function Interface
- Interop between various programming languages
- Use language agnostic build system
- Use best practices
- Integrate tests
- Generate documentation
- Implement profiling

### Secondary

- Learn some more mathematics
- Learn some more physics

## Languages

- C
- C++
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Nodejs
- Prolog
- Rust

And more are coming.

## Prerequisites

### C

* C Compiler
* Make
* CMake
* OpenGL
* GLut

### Elixir

Used mostly by backend

* Erlang
* Erlang Devel Package (ie. erlang-dev) - for NIFs
* Elixir
* Phoenix
* hex
* mix

### Javascript

* nodejs
* npm or yarn
* typescript
* webpack

### Rust

* rustup.rs
* rust
* cargo
* cargo-wasm


## Getting Started

TODO


## Run

To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
